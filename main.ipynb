    "This Notebook is part of the project [Open Power System Data](http://open-power-system-data.org). Open Power System Data develops a platform for free and open data for electricity system modeling. We collect, check, process, document, and provide data that are publicly available but currently inconvenient to use. \n",

    "This file is a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). A Jupyter Notebook is a file that combines executable programming code with visualizations and comments in markdown format, allowing for an intuitive documentation of the code. We use Jupyter Notebooks for combined coding and documentation. We use Python 3 as programming language. All Notebooks are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a platform for software development, and are publicly available. More information on our IT-concept can be found [here](http://open-power-system-data.org/it).
